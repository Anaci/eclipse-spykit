= Installation =

The installation is simple. Just download the Eclipse Spykit Plugin Jar from the Downloads and place it into your <inst_dir>\eclipse\dropins directory. 

Next decide whether you want to spy on your base Eclipse installation (use the -debug command line option) or whether you want to spy on your Run-time Workbench (use the Tracing page of its launch configuration). 

= Spy over Workbench =
  * Start Eclipse with -debug option
  * This will look for a .option file in the <inst_dir>\eclipse foder
  * You can also specify the path of the .option file after - debug
P.S .options file is available for download from the Download Section.
    It is available in the misc folder if you download the Src.

= Spy over Runtime Workbench =
  * Star Eclipse with -debug option
  * This will look for a .option file in the <inst_dir>\eclipse foder
  * You can also specify the path of the .option file after - debug
