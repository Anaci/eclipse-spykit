= Features Planned =

  * Integration into Functional Testing Plugins like Window Builder or SWTBot
    # Based on the events performed by the Automated Functional Test Cases, the Startup Activities of the Plugins would be logged.
    # This would help Programmers to check if the Lazy Loading of the Plugin is happening as expected.
  * Snapshot Compare Facility
    # You would be able to export the Snapshot of the Plugins loaded after each desired set of Events and Compare them against each other.
  * Performance Tuning Dashboard
    # Create a Performance Tuning Dashboard to integrate all the tools
      * i.e. Plugin Performance Tuning, Memory Analyser Tool, Visual VM, Java Monitor Tools. 
    # There are various tools to drive the performance tuning activities, but there is no collaborative tool that helps the performance tuning.
    # The Idea of the dashboard is to support displaying of value from various Performance tuning tools on a single screen like an Overview.
    # Provide them with an easy to work on Dashboard
    # This tool will also enforce the importance of Performance Tuning to Software Developers.  
    # This tool is targeted to support and guide Software Engineers to find out the Pain areas in their project.
